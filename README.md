# Iris Decision Tree algorithm

Aim:
1. Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
2. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

Procedure:
In this task we shall
1. Import the necessary libraries
2. Load the dataset
3. Perform basic analysis on the given dataset to observe and gain insight
4. Define a Decision Tree algorithm
5. Visualize the Decision Tree

Result:
From the given task we were able to 
1. Identify patterns in the data distribution for each column 
2. Create and visualize the Decision Tree algorithm
3. We can now feed any new/test data to this classifier which would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
